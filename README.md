# Connect 4

This simple version of the classic game was made using Turtle graphics from the Tkinter package. The turtle draws a 4x4 board on a pop-up window, and fills it with X's and O's as the two players enter their pieces. Enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 to drop your piece into the corresponding column, and try to get four pieces in a row before your opponent!

#### Set up:
- download Connect4.py
- open and run with a Python interpreter
